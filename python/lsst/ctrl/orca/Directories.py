##
# @brief   a determination of the various directory roots that can be
#              used by a pipeline.
#
# This class takes a "dir" config and a run identifier and converts the
# values into a set of directory paths that a pipeline is allowed to use.
# A typical use might be:
# @code
#   lookup = lsst.daf.base.PropertySet()
#   dirs = Directories(dirConfig, "rlp0220")
#   lookup = dirs.getDirs()
# @endcode
#
# The schema of the input config is expected to have the following keys:
# @verbatim
#   defaultRoot        the default root directory all files read or
#                         written by pipelines deployed on this platform.
#                         This must be an absolute directory.  This can be
#                         overriden by any of the "named role" directories
#                         below.
#   runDirPattern:     the pattern to use for setting the root directory
#                         for a production run.  The result is a directory
#                         relative to the default root directory (set via
#                         defaultRoot).  The format is a python formatting
#                         string using the following dictionary keys:
#                           runid     the unique identifier for the
#                                     production run
#   workDir               a named directory representing the working directory
#                         where pipeline config files are deployed and the
#                         pipeline is started from
#   inputDir              a named directory representing the directory to cache
#                         or find input data
#   outputDir             a named directory representing the directory to write
#                         output data
#   updateDir             a named directory where updatable data is deployed
#   scratchDir            a named directory for temporary files that may be
#                         deleted upon completion ofthe pipeline
